"""Dash callback functions.

This package initializer collects and exposes all callback definitions from separate modules.

Callbacks are imported here from their respective modules and exposed in a single namespace
for easier access and maintainability.

Callbacks should be organized according to logical, practical, or thematic groupings.
This helps keep related functionality together and makes it easier
to extend or replace callbacks as the project evolves.

Before creating a new module, check if an appropriate callback module already exists.

All callbacks should be added in 'register_all_callbacks'.

The actual decorated callbacks should be minimal functions that
call other functions where the main logic resides. This approach supports unit testing,
as decorated functions are otherwise difficult to test.

Functions containing the main logic should be categorized into separate files.
